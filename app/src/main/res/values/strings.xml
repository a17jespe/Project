        This application is a lightweight presentation of different objects owned by companies.
        There are some miscellaneous information about them, while the presentation is simple, I did have plans to incorporate recyclerview for optimized navigation.
        Expansion of this app can be made in aspects regarding editing and adding of new entries.
