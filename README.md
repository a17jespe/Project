#####Introduction 

I kinda messed up my commits. I wanted to swap the baseline of my project to a basic one instead of empty, primarily because the option menu hasn't been working properly in a past implementation I did. 
This resulted in me removing my project and then adding it again, thus purging previous commits. 
The commits hasn't been any impressive as it has only been related to me adapting my past implementation from the [network assignment](https://github.com/a17jespe/mobileapp-programming-networking).
